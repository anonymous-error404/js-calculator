# JavaScript Calculator

## Project Overview

A fully functional calculator application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts including event handling, DOM manipulation, and mathematical operations. The calculator features a clean, intuitive interface with support for basic arithmetic operations and advanced functionality.

**Features:**
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Clear and reset functionality
- Decimal number support
- Keyboard input support
- Error handling for invalid operations
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Memory functions (optional)

## Instructions to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- No additional installations required

### Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anonymous-error404/js-calculator.git

Navigate to the project directory:
bashcd js-calculator

Open the index.html file in your web browser:

Option 1: Double-click the index.html file
Option 2: Use a local development server:
bash# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx http-server

Then navigate to http://localhost:8000



Usage

Click number buttons to input values
Use operation buttons (+, -, ×, ÷) for calculations
Press "=" or Enter key to execute calculations
Use "C" to clear the current input
Use "AC" to clear all calculations
Supports keyboard input for numbers and operations
